                        <p>KOHIMA WAR CEMETERY lies on the battle ground of Garrison Hill. No trace remains of the bungalow, which was destroyed in the fighting, but white concrete lines mark and preserve permanently the historic tennis court.
                        The cemetery now contains 1,420 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and 1 non-war burial.</p>

                <p>Kisama is 12km from Kohima on the National Highway number 39. The gentle slope at the base of a steep mountain peak is the venue for the famed Hornbill Festival.
                The Heritage Villages is designed in the form of an ancient Naga village to give an authentic feel of a true Naga village and the experience of traveling back in time.</p>

                    <p>Dzukou Valley -sometimes spelled Dzükou Valley or Dzüko Valley- sits high        amongst     the clouds, at 2,452 meters above sea level, straddling the         border of Nagaland and    Manipur in northeast India.
                        In summer, vivid green hillocks pave the way for blue mountaintops, and bright flowers wave in the winds amongst the tall grasses. In winter, temperatures drop far lower than one would expect in such tropical states, and Dzukou Valley freezes,sometimes covered in white snow.</p>
